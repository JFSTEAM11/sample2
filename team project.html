    <h3> Energica Ego 45 Limited Editon </h3>
    <img src="https://motorsportsnewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Energica-Motor-Company-Logo.jpg"  width="100%">
    <p>Weighing 258kg the Ego is still as heavy as a touring bike, but it carries its weight well. The ride quality is plush and controlled, the Pirelli Diablo Rosso Corsa tyres ooze grip and it takes little effort to turn and flick through flip-flops. You notice the weight more at low speed and when you’re paddling it around. But Energica has thought of that and given it a reverse gear. Just twist and go…backwards.

 Cornering feels strange on an electric bike at first – like coasting through a bend on a big pushbike. And without an exhaust roaring in your ears, like some sort of continuous warning signal, you don’t ride an electric bike with as much respect as you should…until your first slide reminds you it’s just as easy to lose the front or spin the rear as any normal bike.</p>
     <h3> Vyrus 987 C3 4V</h3>

    <p>When does a ride on your dream bike start to resemble a nightmare? For me it was five minutes into the photo shoot on a dusty, potholed side-road high in the hills above Half Moon Bay, a road better suited for strafing on a supermotard than going knee-down on the world's most expensive and exclusive sportbike. But lensman Kevin Wing was adamant. "Can't you lean that bike over farther?" he shouted in my helmet. "Go around that last pothole and just throw it down on your knee, OK? Then we'll go do some wheelies."</p>
